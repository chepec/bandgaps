## Absolute band edges and band gaps

This R package contains an extensible dataset of absolute band edges and band gaps of many commonly used semiconductor photocatalysts.

[The vignette `data`](https://github.com/chepec/bandgaps/blob/master/doc/data.pdf) presents the full dataset as a nicely typeset LaTeX table (produced using `xtable`).

The package can generate diagrams representing the thermodynamic equilibrium positions of selected semiconductors as the simple line-art commonly used in the field.

[The vignette `diagram`](https://github.com/chepec/bandgaps/blob/master/doc/diagram.pdf) show-cases how we can generate such diagrams with both base graphics and ggplot2. It also includes a publication-quality TikZ-based version of the diagram. All diagrams make use of LaTeX (specifically by using the `siunitx` and `chemformula` packages to typeset units and chemical formulae).
